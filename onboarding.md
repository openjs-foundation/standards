# Onboarding

All participants in the OpenJS Foundation projects and groups must follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
There are further expectations for members who represent the Standards Working Group (hereafter called representatives).

It is understood that representatives may form opinions based on the needs of their employers' or their personal projects. While representing
the Standards Working Group, however, they should decide/discuss/promote based on the interest of the Standards Working Group.

If there is a conflict (due to personal or company specific projects), then the representative should be explicit 
about the hat they are wearing while deciding/discussing/promoting the project.

Since many members are often a part of one or more projects in the foundation, feel free to discuss it with the members 
if there is a potential conflict while representing. The representative can raise an issue and discuss them during 
the Standards Team meeting.

If a representative has an objection or dissent they should express it as early as possible to ensure 
there is ample time to discuss and reach consensus before representing Standards Working Group.

Representatives must also conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. Some general guidelines include:

* When in doubt always wear the least possible hat.
* Aim to remediate first and then discuss. If other members of the team express concerns about actions, acknowledge their concerns by stopping the actions in question and then discuss within the team to come to a common agreement.
* Treat all community members with respect, consideration, and highest standards of ethical conduct.
* Build trust by keeping your promises.
* Be the model of accountability and leadership. Provide the example of ownership and stewardship that everyone can follow to success.
* Commit to ongoing development and learning best practices for governing.
