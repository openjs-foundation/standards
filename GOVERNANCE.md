# OpenJS Standards Working Group

For the current list of the Working Group members, see the project [README.md](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards#working-group-members).

## Members

The [openjs-foundation/standards](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards) GitHub
repository is maintained by the Working Group and additional Members who are
added on an ongoing basis.

* Anyone is invited to attend meetings
* OpenJS Foundation community members participate in [consensus seeking process](#consensus-seeking-process)

## Working Group Membership

Working Group Membership is not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the Working Group.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for Working Group Membership beyond the governance and policies defined in this repository. We recommend that prospective Working Group Members attend meetings and join our [slack channel]() prior to applying for membership.

The following groups automatically qualify for membership:

* OpenJS Foundation CPC Members

## Working Group Meetings

The Working Group meets bi-weekly on Zoom.us. A designated moderator
approved by the Working Group runs the meeting. Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any
Working Group member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***standards-agenda*** tag to the issue.

Prior to each Working Group meeting the moderator will share the agenda with
members of the Working Group. Working Group members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the Working Group
cannot veto or remove items.

The moderator is responsible for recording the meeting notes, and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The Working Group follows a
[Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus, the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus, a Working Group member can call for
the item to be decided by a vote or to table the issue to the next
meeting. In both cases the decision must be seconded by a majority of the Working Group
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins. Only Active
Members participate in a vote.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests require approval by at least two members and must remain open for at least 72 hours before being landed. If there are any objections the Pull Request cannot land until they are resolved.

A pull request that is opposed will be discussed in the meeting.
