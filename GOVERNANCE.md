# OpenJS Standards Group

<!-- yet to add -->
For the current list of Team members, see the project [README.md](./README.md).

## Members

The [openjs-foundation/standards](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards) GitHub
repository is maintained by the Team and additional Members who are
added on an ongoing basis.

* Invited to all meetings
* Can participate in [consensus seeking process](#consensus-seeking-process)
* Counted towards quorum in [Team Meetings](#team-meetings)
* Participates in voting

## Team Membership

Team Membership is not time-limited. There is no fixed size of the Team.

There is no specific set of requirements or qualifications for Team Membership beyond these rules.

The following groups automatically qualify for membership and can request to be added to the GitHub team:

* OpenJS Foundation CPC Members
* OpenJS Foundation Project Maintainers

## Team Meetings

The Team meets bi-weekly on Zoom.us. A designated moderator
approved by the Team runs the meeting. Each meeting should be
published to YouTube.

Items are added to the Team agenda that are considered contentious or
are modifications of governance, contribution policy, Team membership,
or release process.

The intention of the agenda is not to approve or review all patches;
that should happen continuously on GitHub and be handled by the larger
group of Collaborators.

Any community member or contributor can ask that something be added to
the next meeting's agenda by logging a GitHub Issue. Any Collaborator,
Team member or the moderator can add the item to the agenda by adding
the ***standards-agenda*** tag to the issue.

Prior to each Team meeting the moderator will share the agenda with
members of the Team. Team members can add any items they like to the
agenda at the beginning of each meeting. The moderator and the Team
cannot veto or remove items.

The moderator is responsible for summarizing the discussion of each
agenda item and sends it as a pull request after the meeting.

## Attending External Standards Meetings

At various times members of the Standards team or foundation projects will attend Standards Meetings
at external organizations as a representative of the OpenJS Foundation.
If a member would like to attend a meeting as a delegate of the OpenJS Foundation
they should open an issue stating:

* The standards meeting or series of meetings they wish to attend
* The OpenJS Foundation's relationship to this standards organization
* The date and location of the meeting or meetings
* If they will be attending in person or remotely
* The estimated cost to the foundation of their participation
* The scope of the work they plan to participate in

This issue should be labelled with `standards-agenda` and will be approved in the
next team meeting via the consensus seeking process.

## Consensus Seeking Process

The Team follows a
[Consensus Seeking](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus-seeking_decision-making)
decision-making model.

When an agenda item has appeared to reach a consensus, the moderator
will ask "Does anyone object?" as a final call for dissent from the
consensus.

If an agenda item cannot reach a consensus, a Team member can call for
the item to be decided by a vote or to table the issue to the next
meeting. In both cases the decision must be seconded by a majority of the Team
or else the discussion will continue. Simple majority wins. Only Active
Members participate in a vote.

## Pull Requests

Pull requests require approval by at least two members and must remain open for at least 72 hours before being landed. If there are any objections the Pull Request cannot land until they are resolved.

A pull request that is opposed will be discussed in the meeting.
