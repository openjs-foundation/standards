# OpenJS Foundation Standards Working Group

The purpose of this repository is to provide a central coordination and documentation point for project communities about foundation standards activities. 

Interested parties can also [join our #standards channel](https://communityinviter.com/apps/js-foundation/join-openjs-foundation-on-slack) on Slack. 

For historical documents about our standards work as the jQuery Foundation and JS Foundation, please see this [repository](https://github.com/JSFoundation/standards).
