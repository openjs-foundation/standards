# Working Group Member Expectations

All participants in OpenJS Foundation projects and Working Groups must follow the [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/cross-project-council/blob/HEAD/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Standards Working Group Members are expected to participate in discussions related to OpenJS Foundation Projects, open source software, and the standards and specifications that bear on them. They are also expected to educate and mentor newcomers to the field of standardization, lending support and advice to projects pursuing specification development. Finally, they are expected to help export OpenJS Foundation values to the standards communities they work with in order to make standards bodies nicer places to do work.  

There are further expectations for [OpenJS Foundation Representatives](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/blob/main/MEMBER_REPRESENTATION.md) to standards and liaison organizations (hereafter called Representatives).

## Expectations for Representatives
It is understood that Representatives may form opinions based on the needs of their employers, personal projects, or other experiences. While representing the Foundation, however, Representatives should participate based on what is in the best interest of the Foundation and its projects. If there is a conflict (e.g. between the Foundation, its projects, and/or personal or company positions), the Representative should be explicit about which perspective they are speaking from given the issue at hand. 

Representatives must also conduct themselves in a professional and respectful manner. General guidelines include:
* Avoid invoking multiple "roles" when discussing challenging topics. This helps avoid [appeals to authority](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority) or the allusion that one's opinion is fully shared by multiple groups. 
* If conflict arises, aim to remediate first and then discuss. If other members of the group express concerns about actions, acknowledge their concerns by stopping the actions in question and then discuss within the group to come to a common agreement.
* Treat all community members with respect, consideration, and highest standards of ethical conduct. Build trust by clearly communicating and keeping your promises.
* Be the model of accountability and leadership. Provide the example of ownership and stewardship that everyone can follow to success.
* Commit to ongoing development and governance best practices. Contribute good ideas, successful policies, better workflows, and other lessons learned back to the Working Group.
* Follow the contribution guidelines of the organization or project to which you are contributing.

### Building Consensus
Representatives may belong to one or more projects in the Foundation, and as such should feel free to discuss topics with each relevant group. In the case of conflicting opinions between Foundation projects, the Representative may raise an issue to the Standards Working Group for support. 

Representatives or Working Group Members may also call for an ad-hoc meeting to discuss controversial topics, or topics wherein a general consensus view has not yet emerged. Representatives are strongly encouraged to schedule ad-hoc meetings to refine thinking and inform stakeholders prior to plenary or liaison meetings where they will be discussed. Representatives should focus on developing and sharing the consensus of the Foundation and the projects impacted by the topic at hand. 

### Representatives and Decision-making
Some of OpenJS Foundation's memberships and liaison relationships permit Representatives to participate in their formal decision-making processes (e.g. voting). Representatives should disclose any vote to the Standards Working Group, and provide a recommendation. If the Representative has an objection or plans to cast a dissenting vote, they should express it as early as possible to ensure there is ample time to discuss and reach consensus on the intended approach.

### Responsibilities of Representatives

Representatives are expected to:
* Abide by the code of conduct of both the Open JS Foundation _and_ the liaison organization in which they are participating.
* Keep the [OpenJS Foundation Standards Calendar](https://calendar.openjsf.org) current with upcoming liaison meetings, conferences, events, or other deadlines.
* Notify the Standards Working Group of any discussion points, issues, topics, or opportunities for collaboration by opening an issue on this repo. 
* Gather input from other Members, OpenJS Foundation Staff, Project Maintainers, and community members on topics and discussion points relevant to OpenJS Foundation and its projects. 
* Provide liaison update reports to the Standards Working Group following liaison meetings. In the case that there are multiple Representatives participating in a meeting, only one needs to provide an update.
* Help develop and circulate positions on key issues from among relevant OpenJS Foundation projects and stakeholders. Where differences of opinion exist among Foundation participants, Representatives should work to establish a consensus opinion, and/or represent the opposing viewpoints as clearly as possible.

### Becoming a Representative
Community members who would like to officially represent the Foundation or their Project to an external organization should file an issue with the following information:
* The OpenJS Foundation's current relationship to this standards organization
* The scope of the work they plan to participate in (specific technical committees, proposals, interest groups, etc.)
* The relevance and potential impact of the work to OpenJS Foundation Projects
* Any participation costs (e.g. membership dues) needed

Note that new liaisons or memberships must be discussed with OpenJS Foundation Executive Director Robin Ginn and must be approved by the Board of Directors.

## Guidance for Attending External Standards Meetings
Representatives may attend any meeting(s) of the organization they liaise with on behalf of the Foundation. Meetings should be disclosed and later summarized as outlined in [Responsibilities of Representatives](/MEMBER_EXPECTATIONS.md#responsibilities-of-representatives). In-person meetings requiring Travel Fund support should be disclosed as early as possible; note that travel support must be requested in advance and is not guaranteed.

From time to time, non-Representative community members may be asked to participate in a standards meeting as a function of their OpenJS Foundation project, for example as an invited expert. Whether in-person or virtual, any OpenJS community member who will be representing the viewpoint of their Foundation project to an external body should inform the Standards Working Group by filing an issue on this repo. Taking this step helps the Standards Working Group and OpenJS Foundation staff better support you and your project. Please include:

* The meeting or series of meetings you wish to attend
* Topic(s) or proposals you'll be discussing
* The date and location of the meeting or meetings
* If they will be attending in person or remotely
* If you plan to request travel assistance

Non-Representative community members shall not claim to represent the Foundation without prior approval of the Standards Working Group, and should not claim to wholly represent the viewpoint of a Foundation project without the agreement of the project's TSC or leadership group.

**In all cases, it is your responsibility to ensure you have the consent of your employer to participate in any standards organization or project.**
