### openjs-foundation/standards

* Requesting 10 minutes to discuss API translation effort [#144](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/144)

Mike Samuel shared a presentation on supporting many human languages in development environments. Goal is to help pre-English fluent developers navigate english-heavy apis. Issue of factorials in IDE development. Work happening on cross-language Language translation standards. LSP provides the language smarts & map translations. Additive to translation of documentation. Mike requests people who work as devs while pre-fluent to drive goal setting/prioritization; changes to LSP so a language server can connect identifiers to translations; Developer US expertise; A VSCode plugin; registry website; home org to provide structure. Would be good to have a “test project” from openjs but not necessary. OpenJS Collab Space could be helpful. Microsoft is driving a lot of work on LSP and it would be ideal to involve them. 

* Document Delegates & Delegate Approval Process [#142](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/142)

See: https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/blob/main/MEMBER_REPRESENTATION.md
Do we have any strong feelings about how to handle this? No. Jory to open an PR to update the file. Will operationalize this in the future. 

* Discussion Request: Standards/Education & Onboarding Resources [#130](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/130)

Jory has created the new repo and added new issues to the repo. 
Do we want to start with a couple of personas (per Mike Samuel’s idea last time)? How can we do a better job recognizing groups with different needs when it comes to the standards process?
We could start taking notes / collecting examples / figuring out the gaps. Connected back to the AMA. Brian notes that devs have different impressions/frustrations/fears about engaging with SDOs. What comes up a lot is that groups are different even within a SDO. Is there a way to help explain that nuance (e.g. when should you expect a response, why are responses terse? etc).
