## Notes

* @jorydotcom provided a brief overview of the JS Foundation's past and present participation at TC39 and W3C.
* @littledan, @jasnell, @mylesborins, @jorydotcom & others fielded questions about standards participation.
* The group brainstormed ideas for things a standards working group at the OpenJS Foundation could provide to the organization and community (see images below)
* The group came up with several next steps we can take to get started, including:

-[x] create a standards repo
-[] create a calendar of events 
-[] schedule another working meeting
-[] create a standards 'team' to collaborate on GH
-[] confirm standards travel budget (board follow-up)
