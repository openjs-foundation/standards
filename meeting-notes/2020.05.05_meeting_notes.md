### openjs-foundation/standards

* Nominate OSI Representative [#89](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/89)
Scope is not well known
Myles self nominated.  Cross posted to CPC.
Robin why is this limited to standards?
Myles: charter includes “manage relationships with standards organizations”
Jordan: who do we want to reach who is not in standards WG and would be appropriate nominee?
Jory: ok to cross post.  If projects are paying attention to one [GH project] it’s probably CPC
Robin: Is OSI just a “standards organization”?
Myles: [If CPC wants to undelegate] do we need to massage the standards charter.  CPC should be careful before acting on something that seems to have been delegated.
Jordan: Robin, what is OSI
Robin: Interactions with OSI include things unrelated to technical standards making
Brian: It's sometimes a little hard to say "what is an SDO" it is listed on http://www.openstandards.net/viewOSnet2C.jsp?showModuleName=Organizations for example and W3C was created with the view that it wouldn't be an SDO, but it is largely seen as one.
Myles: OSI may be on the line.  There may be other organizations which are on the line but which Standards WG wants to manage, and seek CPC approval for delegation of additions.  A list would clarify.
Jory: Nomination will remain open for a week.

* Discuss foundation TC39 delegate expectations [#84](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/84)

Current discussion is over thematic disagreement over individual autonomy, for example to block consensus
Relationship between the Foundation as a Member Trade org, and its membership / expectations for participation in an SDO
Action Item: if people expressed opinions last meeting or have thoughts from this meeting, please add them to issue #84.
Myles: actions taken by delegates on behalf of OpenJS Fdn should be “built on a bed of consensus”
Jordan: my experience from TC39 is people are clearly balancing their own opinions and their organizational duties.  Some employers put people on leash, but it’s not infrequent for people to say “my opinion is ...; my employer wants …”
Jordan: power to block comes from procedures
Myles: blocking is voting
Jordan disagrees with framing
Mike Samuel: Need rigorous facility for assessing / building consensus or opinions (see comment) but ultimately have to trust delegates to advance their understanding of the consensus and deal with repeated failure to represent consensus after the fact.
Brian: Blocking seems a discrete question so we can build a process specifically for that.
Robin: I spoke up last week supporting Myles.
Jordan: Any action has to be justified after the fact.  In TC39, most actions are blocking.  Not advocating for lack of accountability; just for not constraining actions [in unforeseen situations?].  The perception of blocking as a hammer does not match my experiences with TC39 specifically; blocking is often a good thing since the organization biases towards not changing the language.

* Request to participate in TC39 as OpenJS delegate [#83](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/83)

* Collect info from standards meeting attendees [#81](https://github.com/openjs-foundation/standards/issues/81)

The Standards Working Group actively monitors evolving standards to educate projects about developments that might affect them, and helps projects formulate standards strategies and advance them before standards bodies.
